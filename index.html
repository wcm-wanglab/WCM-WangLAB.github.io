		<br>
		
		<p>I am now a postdoctoral researcher in the <a href="https://phs.weill.cornell.edu">Department of Population Health Sciences </a> at 
		   <a style="color: #CC5500;" href="https://weill.cornell.edu">Weill Cornell Medicine</a>, 
		   advised by <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/cornellwanglab/home">Professor Fei Wang</a>.
		   From 08/01/2019 to 07/31/2020, I was a postdoctoral researcher in the <a href="https://ece.duke.edu">Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering </a>
		 at <a style="color: #CC5500;" href="https://www.duke.edu">Duke University</a>, 
		advised by <a href="http://people.ee.duke.edu/~lcarin/">Professor Lawrence Carin</a>.
		
		<br>
		<br>
		I received my B.Sc. and Ph.D. from <a href="https://en.xidian.edu.cn">Xidian University</a> in 2012 and 2019, respectively. 
		My Ph.D. advisor was Professor <a href="https://web.xidian.edu.cn/bchen/en/index.html">Bo Chen</a>. 
		I was also advised by Professor <a href="https://mingyuanzhou.github.io">Mingyuan Zhou</a>, an associate professor from the University of Texas at Austin.
		
		<br>
		<br>My research lies at the intersection of Bayesian statistics and machine learning. 
		I am interested in statistical methods, hierarchical models, statistical inference for big data, and deep learning. 
		I am currently focused on advancing both statistical inference with deep learning, deep learning with probabilistic methods and their applications to Natural Language Processing.

		<h3>Research Highlights  </h3>
		<ul>
			
		<p> 
			
<li> [August, 2020] I joined the group of Professor Fei Wang at Weill Cornell Medicine, as a posdoctoral researcher. </li>
			
		<p>

<li> [July, 2020] Our paper "BIRNAT: Bidirectional Recurrent Neural Networks with Adversarial Training for Video Snapshot Compressive Imaging" with Ziheng Cheng, Ruiying Lu, Zhengjue Wang, Bo Chen, Ziyi Meng, and Xin Yuan 
	           will be presented in <a href="https://eccv2020.eu/">ECCV2020</a>. This work is about the problem of reconstruction of video snapshot compressive imaging (SCI) and we build a bidirectional RNN for this task. 
	           Our work achieves the SOTA performance on this task among existing deep learning methods.
                 <p>
	
<li> [June, 2020] Our paper "Students Need More Attention: BERT-based Attention Model for Small Data with Application to Automatic Patient Message Triage" with Shijing Si, Rui Wang, Jedrek Wosik, David Dov, Guoyin Wang, Ricardo Henao, and Lawrence Carin
			will be presented in <a href="https://www.mlforhc.org/">MLHC2020</a>. This work is to build a model based on BERT for patient portal message triage that classifies the urgency of a message into three categories: 
			non-urgent, medium and urgent.
			</li>	
			
	         <p>		
<li> [June, 2020] Our paper "Autoencoding Topic Model with Scalable Hybrid Bayesian Inference" with Bo Chen, Yulai Cong, Dandan Guo, Hongwei Liu, and Mingyuan Zhou
			will be published in IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence. This work is about building an autoneconding hierarchical topic model for document analysis.
			</li>	
			
		<p>	
<li> [Janurary, 2020] Our paper "Learning Dynamic Hierarchical Topic Graph with Graph Convolutional Network for Document Classication" with Zhengjue Wang, Chaojie Wang, Zhibin Duan, Bo Chen, and Mingyuan Zhou
			will be presented in <a href="https://www.aistats.org">AISTATS2020</a>. This work is about building a dynamic document graph 
			with the help of a hierarhcical topic model for document classification. Hope to see you in Palermo, Sicily, Italy, in June 2020.
			</li>	
			
			
		<p>					
<li> [December, 2019] Our paper "Variational Hetero-Encoder Randomized GANs for Joint Image-Text Modeling" with Long Tian, Bo Chen, Zhengjue Wang, and Mingyuan Zhou
		      will be presented as a poster in <a href="https://iclr.cc">ICLR2020</a>. 
		      This work is about a novel Bayesian deep learning framework that captures and relates hierarchical semantic and visual concepts, performing well on a variety of image and text modeling and generation tasks. 
	              Hope to see you in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia in April, 2020.
			</li>	
			
		<p>					
<li> [August, 2019] I joined the group of Professor Lawrence Carin at Duke University, as a posdoctoral researcher. </li>		
			
		<p>					
<li> [June, 2019] I recieved my Ph.D. from Xidian University advised by Professor Bo Chen, Xi'an, China. 
	         Thanks for Professor Bo Chen and Professor Mingyuan Zhou from UT-Austin. </li>
