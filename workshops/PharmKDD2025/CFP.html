		<h1>PharmKDD 2025 Call For Papers</h1>
		
		
		<font style="font-weight: bold">Description</font>
		<br>
		
		Pharmaceutical research and development (PRD) refers to the process of discovering and developing medicines and treatments. 
		It is an expensive ($1-2.6 billion on average) and time consuming (10-15 years on average)  process. Despite the time and monetary 
		investments, historical data shows that the success rate of a new drug from discovery to final approval from the Food and Drug 
		Administration is only around 10%. This fact highlights the urgent need for innovative methods to improve the efficiency and success 
		rate of the PRD process.<br>
		<br>


		There are many steps in the PRD pipeline, which includes target identification, molecule design and synthesis, pre-clinical development, 
		human clinical trials, and post-marketing surveillance. Over the years, large volumes of data have been accumulated from these different 
		steps, which encode evidence and insights of the PRD process. This provides an unprecedented opportunity for developing effective data 
		mining and knowledge discovery (KDD) methods to extract insights from those data to improve the PRD process. Furthermore, advances in 
		deep phenotyping using AI have greatly expanded the disease landscape, capturing a richer spectrum of disease attributes and patient 
		subtypes, which in turn elevates drug discovery efforts by refining target identification and validationâ€”effectively transforming the 
		other side of the therapeutic equation into a more precise, data-driven realm of innovation.<br>
		<br>


		There are lots of examples of recent research developing KDD methods for PRD. However, the existing research has been mostly isolated 
		into different communities 
		focusing on a particular intermediate step, while we cannot have any of these steps fail in order to successfully develop a drug. 
		Therefore, there is an urgent need for a forum to bring together researchers and practitioners from both academia and industry working 
		on different aspects of KDD for PRD, discuss the state-of-the-art research and technologies, and chart the future agenda.<br>
		<br>
		
		<font style="font-weight: bold">Topics of Interests</font>
		<br>

		All topics on KDD for pharmaceutical research and development are welcome to submit, including but not limited to the following

		<ul style="margin-left: 30px">
			<li>Drug molecule design and prediction</li>
			<li>KDD for preclinical studies, such as cell line and animal models</li>
			<li>Large language models for pharmaceutical research and development</li>
			<li>Pharmaceutical knowledge graph construction and inference</li>
		
		</ul>

		<font style="font-weight: bold">Submission Guidelines</font>
		<br>
		
		<ul style="margin-left: 30px">
			
		<li><font style="font-weight: bold">Format</font>: We invite short technical papers - up to 5 pages including references and unlimited pages of appendix. 
		      All manuscripts should be submitted in a single PDF file including all content, figures, tables, and references, 
		      following the new Standard ACM Conference Proceedings Template. For LaTeX users: unzip acmart.zip, make, and use sample-sigconf.tex as a template;
		      Additional information about formatting and style files is available online at 
		      <a href="https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template">ACM Proceedings Template</a>. 
		      Additionally, papers must be in the two-column format, with the recommended setting for Latex file: 
		      <font style="color: red">\documentclass[sigconf, anonymous, review]{acmart}</font>.</li>

	    <li><font style="font-weight: bold">Camera ready</font>: Accepted papers can have up to 5 pages and unlimited pages of references and appendix. 
	      Please use the new <font style="color: red">acmart.cls</font> when preparing submissions.</li>
	
	    <li><font style="font-weight: bold">Submission</font>: Papers should be submitted at the 
	      <a href="https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=pharmkdd2025">easychair submission website</a>.</li>
	
	    <li><font style="font-weight: bold">Review</font>: All papers will be double-blinded and peer-reviewed by at least 2 reviewers.</li>
	
	    <li><font style="font-weight: bold">Presentation</font>: While all accepted papers will be presented with posters, high-quality accepted papers will also have the 
	      opportunity to participate in the oral/spotlight presentation and win our Best Paper Award(s). All accepted papers are expected 
	      to be presented in person. The workshop will not provide support for virtual talks or posters. 
	      We will also present accepted papers on our website.</li>
	
	    <li><font style="font-weight: bold">Proceedings</font>:According to the policy of the KDD conference, the accepted papers will NOT be included in proceedings or any form of publication.</li>
